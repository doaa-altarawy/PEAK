DREAM5 network predictions
==========================

The complete set of network predictions submitted by the 29 challenge participants. Predictions from the 6 off-the-shelf methods and the community integration are also included. These predictions were evaluated using the gold standards and scripts provided in Supplementary File 1.

These are the predictions using anonymized gene names as submitted by the participants. A mapping to real gene names is included in Supplementary File 1. The community predictions are given in de-anonymized form (and with decoys excluded) in Supplementary File 4.

Networks
